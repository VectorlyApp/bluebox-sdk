  "method": "POST",
  "explanation": "This POST to the availability v3 search endpoint includes a single-day date window (beginDate and endDate both 2025-10-31) with origin BOS, destination MIA, and 1 adult, which corresponds to a one-way availability query that returns flight options and pricing, as captured in the request payload and 200 response . A separate low-fare calendar endpoint exists (v2/lowfare) used for calendar fare ranges rather than listing flight options, which is why v3/search is the direct match for one-way options and prices .",
